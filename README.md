Tap and Go: The Rise of NFC Bus Tickets in India
Kolkata, India â€“ While the convenience of tapping a card or phone to pay for a bus ride is becoming a reality in several Indian cities, Kolkata is still on the journey to fully implement a widespread Near Field Communication (NFC) ticketing system for its local bus network. However, the groundwork is being laid for a more seamless and digital public transport experience in the city.
Currently, for local bus travel within Kolkata, commuters primarily rely on traditional paper tickets issued by conductors. While various apps provide real-time bus tracking and route information, a direct and operational NFC-based payment system for the West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) buses is yet to be rolled out comprehensively.
